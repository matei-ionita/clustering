# clustering
examples and data for work on clustering

## Background
This repository contains Matei's Rmd lecture on clustering.  I've also included a dataset from FlowRepository that aims to explore changes in the human immune system due to age.  You may find these data useful for your work on clustering, if you do not have data of your own to work with.
