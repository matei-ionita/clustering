# clustering
Project for exploration of clustering approaches

## Background
This repository contains Matei's Rmd lecture on clustering.  

I also recommend that you download the Young/Old FlowRepository dataset.  To do so:
1.  Install the FlowRepositoryR package
1.  Using that package, retrieve the FR-FCM-ZZGS dataset
1.  Look at the code in this git repository as suggestion/guidance for how to
QC and pre-gate the data

After that, have fun!  Try FlowSOM.  Think of your own ideas for clustering
and population identification.  Look for T cell subsets that differ significantly
between young and old subjects.
